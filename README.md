2048: An Agent Based Solver
=======================
The popular web game 2048 (https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) (designed by Gabriele Cirulli) is a game in which a single player plays against the randomness of the game.

Task at hand
------------
Creating an AI that can play the game well enough to reliably win. If the AI is winning then I will try to optimize it to get as high a score as possible.

Specific to the AI Agent
------------------------
It must select its move within one sixtieth of a second (that is, it must make 60 moves a second or more). Since the game is random we will test the agent a number of times to collect a set of scores. All agents capable of winning the game will be submitted to a friendly inÂ­class competition for highest score.
